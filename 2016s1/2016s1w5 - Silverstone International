[b]TRACK NOTES[/b]
These track notes deal with overtaking and race tactics. The demo laps will show how to drive around the track.
The notes are mainly meant as a guideline for less experienced drivers. They are general observations but, of course, every race situation is different.
[i] Please feel free to provide corrections or improvements to these notes - they will all be welcomed![/i] :)

[u][i]Turn 1 Right - Copse[/i][/u]
Copse can be a difficult corner even by yourself, it doesn't get easier with a car alongside you. Do not attempt to pass here if you can avoid it, there are much safer spots on the track.

[u][i]Turns 2-6 - Maggots, Becketts, Chapel[/i][/u]
This looks like a good overtaking spot on the map but it is much more difficult in reality.
The problem is that the line through these tightly connected corners is very narrow. Side by side is possible only if both drivers leave room to each other. Instead, get a good exit from Chapel and use the darft to pass on the following Hangar Straight.

[u][i]Turn 7 right - Stowe [/i][/u]
One of the main overtaking spots on the track. Draft on the long hangar straight and try to complete your pass before the corner, if you can. Otherwise you might find yourself side by side until the Vale/Club complex

[u][i]Turns 8-10 - Vale & Club [/i][/u]
This layout uses the smoother historical layout through the left/right of T8/9, unlike the very sharp left hander from the 'Southern' layout, making a side-by-side line here easier. Fighting here might not be a good idea though, instead concentrate on getting a good exit to pass on the following straight.

[u][i]Turn 12 and 13 - Bridge and Priory[/i][/u]
Another good overtaking opportunity entering the Priory left hander. Just be careful not to drift out onto another car in turn 12 right (Bridge); keep your line and complete the pass in turn 13

[u][i]Turn 14 left - Brooklands [/i][/u]
While it looks like it might be possible to complete a pass here, be aware that cars ahead of you will cut sharply to the apex and rapidly close any gap. Be careful to avoid even accidental dive bombing.

[u][i]Turns 15 and 16 - Luffield and Woodcote [/i][/u]
These are not good overtaking places. The track is wide and cars can go side by side to complete a pass initiated in the previous corners but it is otherwise difficult to pass here.
