[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series, [b] Silverstone International - Week 5[/b] of 12 - 2016 Season 1[/size][/color]

[i]Welcome to the SRF.
We pride ourselves on a friendly, competitive and yet relaxed atmosphere both on- and off-track.
As a reminder, you can complete a full 8 weeks season just by acquiring 3 paid tracks, if you don't have any.

Don't be ashamed to ask for help, either in practice sessions or on the forum.
The weather settings are different in each session. No point comparing laptimes from different servers.[/i]


First visit of the season to Silverstone. We'll come back to another configuration in a few weeks.

Race Distance: 16 laps, approx 28 minutes


[b]TRACK NOTES[/b]

These track notes deal with overtaking and race tactics. The demo laps will show how to drive around the track.
The notes are mainly meant as a guideline for less experienced drivers. They are valid observations but, of course, every race situation is different.

[u][i]Turn 1 Right - Copse [/i][/u]
Copse can be a difficult corner even by yourself, it doesn't get easier with a car alongside you.
Do not attempt to pass here if you can avoid it, there are much safer spots in the track.


[u][i]Turn 2 to 4 -Maggots [/i][/u]
This looks like a good overtaking spot on the map but it is much more difficult in reality.
The problem is that the line through these tightly connected corners is very narrow. Side by side is possible only if both drivers leave room to each other. Braking for the final right hander of the international configuration is difficult, which makes things even riskier.
Again, do not attempt to overtake here unless you really have to.


[u][i]Turn 5 left - Abbey hairpin [/i][/u]
Main overtaking spot on the track. Draft on the long straight and then either attack under braking or get a good exit speed and pass after the hairpin.

[u][i]Turn 6 and 7 - Bridge and Priory[/i][/u]
Another good overtaking opportunity entering the Priory left hander. Just be careful not to drift onto another car in turn 6 right (Bridge); keep your line and complete the pass in turn 7


[u][i]Turn 8 left - Brooklands [/i][/u]
It might be possible to complete a pass here in certain circumstances. Just be aware that cars ahead of you will cut sharply to the apex and rapidly close any gap; avoid dive bombing.

Turn 9 and 10 are not overtaking places.
The track is wide and cars can go side by side to complete a pass initiated in the previous corners but it is otherwise difficult to pass here.
