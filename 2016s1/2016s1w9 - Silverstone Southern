[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series, [b] Silverstone Southern - Week 9[/b] of 12 - 2016 Season 1[/size][/color]

[i]Welcome to the SRF.
We pride ourselves on a friendly, competitive and yet relaxed atmosphere both on- and off-track.
As a reminder, you can complete a full 8 weeks season just by acquiring 3 paid tracks, if you don't have any.

Don't be ashamed to ask for help, either in practice sessions or on the forum. 
The weather settings are different in each session. No point comparing laptimes from different servers.[/i]


Second visit to the Silverstone circuit. Another short configuration before we move to the full circuit next season.

Race Distance: 18 laps, approx 25 minutes


[b]TRACK NOTES[/b]

These track notes deal with overtaking and race tactics. The demo laps will show how to drive around the track.
The notes are mainly meant as a guideline for less experienced drivers. They are valid observations but, of course, every race situation is different.

- Pit Entrance -
The pit entrance is rather annoying but luckily we do not need it in SRF races. You will have to cut across the grass to reach the pits, taking a 1x in the process.

[u][i]Turn 1 Left - [/i][/u]
The first corner is very sharp but the track is wide and invites to take slightly different lines. This can cause problems at race start. Please be careful and patient, avoid dive bombing.
A part from the start, passes can be completed here both on the inside and outside (inside for the 2nd corner) if you can get alongside before the corner.

[u][i]Chicanes at turn 4 and 7 [/i][/u]
Narrow lines through these chicanes; it is very difficult to go safely side by side. Attacks here are not recommended in normal circumstances.

[u][i]Turn 10 Right - Stowe[/i][/u]
Main overtaking spot on the track. Draft on the long hangar straight and try to complete your pass before the corner, if you can. Otherwise you might find yourself side by side until the turn 1 - turn 2 chicane.
