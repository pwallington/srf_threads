[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series @ [b] Daytona ca.2007 - Bike [/b]
Week 4 of 12 - 2016 Season 4 [/size][/color]
Race Distance: 12 laps, approximately 25 minutes

Week 4 takes us to the 2007 version of Daytona International Speedway, on the challenging Bike layout. This is probably one of the most technical free content track layouts on the service, and really rewards diligent practice and clean driving.

[color=red]IMPORTANT NOTE
It is illegal to drive on the apron, for safety reasons. 
Rule:
"Drivers can only use the racing surface for qualifying and racing. The apron is not defined as racing surface, example Daytona Road Course. Cars may not use the apron to gain an advantage in qualifying or racing."[/color][/b][/size]

[size=18][b]TRACK FAMILIARISATION VIDEOS[/b][/size]
Recording of the "track walk" kindly provided by Ed Forer in a 2016s1 practice session. Unfortunately the recording missed the first part of the first lap. The focus during this discussion was on correct car placement rather than absolute pace.

[size=18][b]TRACK NOTES[/b][/size]
The draft around the oval section is HUGE. SRF draft extends to almost 1.5 seconds behind the car, so you will have a great opportunity to pass here. Please be patient and avoid spoiling the race for yourself and others by attempting passes in bad spots! 

In particular, the entrance to T1 can be [b]very [/b]tricky due to the angle of the braking zone coming down off the banking. Take extra care going side-by-side into this corner.

More detailed track notes to follow, or please contribute your own notes!

(Suggestions/improvements to this reference info are always appreciated!)

Read this first: [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/2022116.page] Zen and the Art of the Spec Racer Ford [/url]

The recently updated [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3475225.page]baseline setup[/url] is an excellent starting point for any driver.

Ed Forer posted his "use anywhere" setup for anyone to use, [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3491136.page]check it out here[/url]

You can complete a full 8 week season by acquiring [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3288130.page]only 3 paid tracks[/url], if you don't have any.

N.B. The weather settings are random in each session, greatly affecting lap times. Take note of the weather when comparing laptimes from different servers.
