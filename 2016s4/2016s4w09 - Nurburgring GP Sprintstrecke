[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series @ [b]  [/b]
Week 9 of 12 - 2016 Season 4 [/size][/color]
Race Distance: 15 laps, approximately 25 minutes

Week 9 takes us back to Germany for our second visit to the Nurburgring Grand Prix track. This time we are using the 'Sprintstrecke' layout, which takes the other half of the full track, cutting off turns 6-10 of the Grand-Prix layout. This is a challenging and technical modern track, with the slow twisting 'arena' section followed by some much faster areas. With the long front straight drafting is sure to play a role here too.

This is a brand-new track layout so no guides available yet. Would anyone like to give a walkthrough of a lap?

[size=18][b]TRACK NOTES[/b][/size]

[b][u]T1 - Hairpin right [/u][/b]
A very tight, blind hairpin - look for the small bollard marking the apex. [b]CAUTION:[/b] The track drops sharply at the apex, easily unsettling the car which can spin you easily - make sure you anticipate the drop and are being extra-smooth through here. 
With a good draft down the front straight this should be your best opportunity to pass; HOWEVER, be careful not to dive-bomb! Ensure you can get fully alongside before committing to the overtake. As the hairpin is so tight and has an uneven surface, it can be difficult to make side-by-side driving through here work.

[b][u]T2 - Left (Mercedes Arena)[/b][/u] 
The first long left hand corner of the mercedes arena follows immediately from the hairpin. This can make an over/under pass back of someone outbraking you into the hairpin very challenging, as you find yourself stuck on the outstide of this long corner. The slight crest hides the flat kerb on the exit - there is plenty of runoff available at the cost of a 1x penalty.

[b][u]T3/T4 - Left/Right (Mercedes Arena)[/b][/u]
There's no time to relax before you hit this tight left-right combo. In order to get a good line out of the second corner it's important to apex very late on the first one - look for the grey marking inside the apex kerb. 
In order to maximise your exit speed aim to track out right over where the shortcut rejoins. You can use the green concrete without getting a penalty but watch out for the astorturf immediately before it - this is considered 'off-track'

[b][u]T5 - Right (Shortcut)[/u][/b]
The short run down to T5 isn't really an overtaking opportunity unless you get a much better exit from T4 than the car ahead. The track drops away through the first half of this double-apex turn and there is a very nasty bump right inbetween the apexes. You'll need to make sure the car is steady at this point to avoid spinning. If the car is grounding too much here you may need to increase your ride height.

[b][u]T6 - Left[/u][/b]
This fast sweeping left comes too soon after the shortcut to be an overtaking opportunity in this layout (unlike the full Grand-Prix layout). There's more green concrete you can use on both the apex and exit kerbs but be careful on the exit as T7 is coming up fast. 

[b][u]T7 - Right (Bilstein Kurve)[/u][/b]
This fast descending right hander is a test of bravery as the exit speed is critical for the back straight that immediately follows. A poor exit here will make you vulnerable to attack into the chicane, but the entrance is an almost-immediate change of direction form the exit of the previous corner, making it a challenge to get right.

[b][u]T9 - Left/Right (Veedol-Schikane)[/u][/b]
This layout uses the tighter, slower, variation of the Veedol Chicane following the back straight. Much like the Fogarty Esses as Donington the line through here is very tight, and the high kerbs are brutal. Be VERY cautious about going side-by-side through here - it's probably wiser to back out than risk a collision! There's generous run-off on the right through the other chicane layout, but it comes with a hefty time penalty. Being able to manage your car over the bumps will be critical to getting the fastest line through here.

[b][u]T10 - Right (T13)[/u][/b]
The final corner of the lap is a tough one, and it's vitally important to get a good exit as it leads directly onto the start/finish straight. Just to make things even harder the corner tightens significantly, so you'll want to apex as late as you can - around the start of the pit wall. However, [b]be careful not to hit the cushion on the front edge of the barrier[/b], as it comes right out to the inner edge of the red and white kerbing.
