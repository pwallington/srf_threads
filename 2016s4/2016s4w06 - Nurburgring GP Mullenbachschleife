[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series @ [b] Nurburgring Grand Prix Strecke - Mullenbachschleife [/b]
Week 6 of 12 - 2016 Season 4 [/size][/color]
Race Distance: 30 laps, approximately 25 minutes

For week 6 we head to Germany for our first-ever visit to the famous Nurburgring Grand Prix track. This week we'll be using the short 'Mullenbachschleife' layout, a short, twisting track that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole race! N.B. The entrance to the crossover section is VERY tight and narrow - please be careful especially in the first laps of the race!

[size=18][b]TRACK NOTES[/b][/size]

This super-short layout takes the Ford-Kurve, Dunlop-Kehre (hairpin) and Michael-Schumacher-S from the Grand Prix track, joining them with a very tight and narrow walled-in escape road. 

[b][u]T1 Dunlop-Kehre, Haripin Right[/u][/b]
The first corner of the lap is the famous Dunlop haripin. With a good run out of the previous corner and the draft on the short straight you can make a pass inside or outside here. This is a very long corner, almost double-apex, so be patient getting back on the throttle to avoid tracking out into the gravel. 

[b][u]T2-3 Michael-Schumacher-S[/u][/b]
Flat out in the SRF, these sweeping left-right corners can give an opportunity to get alongside if you have a good run out of the hairpin. The kerbs are high enough to bottom-out the car with baseline ride-height, so be careful if you want to use them!

[b][u]T4-5-6 (access road)[/u][/b]
[color=red][b]Caution[/b][/color] immediately after the S is the [b]extremely[/b] tight T4 entrance to the access road. With a bump at the apex and walls lining the narrow track this is a very dangerous section. Take care not to dive-bomb the car in front - trying to overtake here will cost you a lot of time and isn't worth the risk. 
The exit of T4 is compromised to get an acceptable line into the blind T5 left-hander. With no kerb on the inside and few reference marks it's easy to run wide as the car goes light over the crest. 
T6 right follows immediately, and while it's not a difficult corner you need to compromise the exit of T5 to avoid losing time here.

[b][u]T7 Ford-Kurve[/u][/b]
With a lot of kerb available on the exit for track-out it's important to get as fast an exit as possible from this descending corner, setting you up for a pass down the straight and into the following haripin. The compression and camber both help to turn the car, so this corner is faster than you might expect from looking at the map.
