Week 2 of 12 - 2016 Season 4 [/size][/color]
Race Distance: 10 laps, approximately 25 minutes

For week 2 we travel to Italy for the SRF's first official visit to the iconic Imola Grand Prix track. While this track is new to iRacing last season, it has a long history of top-flight racing going back to 1953. A mix of fast straights and tight chicanes makes for lots of overtaking and intense battles here!

The recently updated [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3475225.page]baseline setup[/url] is an excellent starting point for any driver.

You can complete a full 8 week season by acquiring [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3288130.page]only 3 paid tracks[/url], if you don't have any.

N.B. The weather settings are random in each session, greatly affecting lap times. Take note of the weather when comparing laptimes from different servers.
