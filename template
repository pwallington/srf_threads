The recently updated [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3475225.page]baseline setup[/url] is an excellent starting point for any driver.

Ed Forer just posted his "use anywhere" setup for anyone to use, [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3491136.page]check it out here[/url]

You can complete a full 8 week season by acquiring [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3288130.page]only 3 paid tracks[/url], if you don't have any.

N.B. The weather settings are random in each session, greatly affecting lap times. Take note of the weather when comparing laptimes from different servers.
