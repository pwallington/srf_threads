[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series @ [b] Virginia International Raceway (VIR) - North[/b]
Week 5 of 12 - 2017 Season 2 [/size][/color]
Race Distance: [b]15 laps[/b], approximately 25 minutes
World Record lap time (qualifying): [b]1:36.187[/b] by David Gaspers
(n.b. random/dynamic weather impacts lap times greatly)

This week we are back state side with a trip to the VIR North Circuit. This track can be challenging with some very fast sections and demanding corner complexes. Especially watch out over the back of the course through the sweepers down hill and expect to find quite a few people grass tracking off the circuit on the last corner. Participation here can be not so good, so please help others out by registering for races earleier rather than later! This way we get the best chance for official sessions.

Target "planned" SoF race is usually 20:45 GMT Sunday, immediately following the Weekend Warriors league race.

[size=18][b]TRACK NOTES[/b][/size]

Not a full turn-by-turn, but some suggestions courtesy of Car Vetters:
[b][u]T1:[/u][/b] brake just before the 2 sign, try to carry as much speed as possible in the turn. The color of the track shows the right line: you stay on the darker part, as close as possible to the lighter part. Where you get a lighter part of asphalt at the right (at the ned of the curb), you start accelerating. 
[b][u]T3:[/u][/b] you can go earlier on throttle than you might think 
[b][u]T4:[/u][/b] compromise turn. When you go on throttle at the exit, you must choose a line that permits you to keep full throttle until you brake for the uphill (T7) 
[b][u]T7:[/u][/b] late apex, if you apex to early, you will upset the car on the bumps at the inside of the turn. When you go on throttle, you have a section without braking until you arrive at T14-14a. Just a short lift needed for T10. 
[b][u]T14a:[/u][/b] another compromise turn: what counts here is the right positioning that gives you a fast passage through T15. 
[b][u]T16-17:[/u][/b] serial killers. You should be a perfect weight transfer manager here. Lift for T16, carefull braking between T16 and T17, and go carefully on throttle at exit. All this should be done without upsetting the car. You will need a lot of practice to find the right line, the righ braking amount, acceleration moment and the spots to avoid (bottoming --> spinning).
