[size=18][b]TRACK NOTES[/b][/size]

(Notes courtesy of Luca Varani)

[u][i]Turn 1 Right - First corner [/i][/u]
You need to get a good exit out of the last corner, get the draft and then attack on the inside under braking.
Please be sure to be alongside when you start an attack. Drivers take a relatively late apex here and sometimes this makes people decide to dive in under heavy braking... but it's not a gap, if you dive into it you will cause contact when the other car closes the corner.

[u][i]Turn 2 left - Williams [/i][/u]
Not a passing place. It is very difficult to navigate this corner side by side.
If overtaking starts in T1R and continues into this corner be ready to slow down (a lot) to leave sufficient room for parallel driving here.

[u][i]Turn 4 right - Attwood Curve  [/i][/u]
Passing on the inside might be doable here, at least in theory. It might be better, however, to concentrate on corner exit, use the draft in the long straight and attack under braking for the following corner.

[u][i]Turn 5 right, - Hairpin [/i][/u]
Main overtaking spot on the track. Draft on the longest straight of the circuit and then attack under braking. Both inside and outside lines might work, since being on the outside at the hairpin means being inside in the following 2 corners.

[u][i]Turn 6 and 7 Left - Revolver and Piper[/i][/u]
Difficult corners with a narrow lines. Not a place to start a pass, although sometimes overtakes are finished here.

[u][i]Turn 8 left - Redman  [/i][/u]
If you can get a good exit out of T7L you can get on the inside and complete the pass under braking for this slow hairpin.
Once again, avoid dive bombing: it's easy to hit cars on the sidepod and spin them around. Don't do it.

[u][i]Turn 9 right - Hobbs  [/i][/u]
This is not a good passing place unless the car ahead makes a mistake.
Overtakes that start in T8L may very well be completed in T9R, but it is usually better not to initiate a pass in T9R itself. Once again, it is very easy to delay braking and dive on the inside of a car taking a late apex, causing contact. This is not a legitimate way to pass. You must be alongside at turn-in to have corner rights.

[u][i]Turn 10 and 11 Right - Mike Knight and Last Corner[/i][/u]
These are not passing places. T6R is just a very fast kink with a narrow line; side by side here is generally impossible.
Attacking at corner entry in Turn 7 right is just pointless; you will slow both cars down and pay a huge price in the following long straight. Concentrate in getting a good exit from the corner and you will execute a much safer and more effective pass on the start/finish straight.
