Week 4 of 12 - 2018 Season 4 [/size][/color]

Week 4 takes us back to Mosport (pronounced "moe-sport"), regularly visited by NASCAR series and more conventional road racers alike. This is a fast flowing track with a great rhythm and is great fun to race at.

Target "planned" SoF race is usually 20:45 GMT Sunday, immediately following the Weekend Warriors league race.

This write-up is intended to help them. 

[b][u]Materials you can watch: [/u][/b]

my demolap 1:34.399: http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3318410.page#9022580 
Ronny's replay: 1.34.155: http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3320012.page#9049770 

Both laps are done with this seasons weather, just like Edward Forer's 1.34.134 and 1.33.718 laps 


[b][u] General characteristics of the track: [/u][/b]

* Not so much braking: only 3 or 4 braking moments and only 1 heavy braking 
* Several long sweepers, where you just lift, wthout braking 
* The difficult Moss (T5-6) turns where exit speed to the straight is crucial for a good laptime 
* The whole track is done in 4th and 5th gear, except Moss that you take in third 

Comparing our three laps, (EDIT: for Edward, it's his 1.34.134 lap) 

* we all do the same except one thing: Ronny does no brake for T10, what makes him the fastest of us in that sector 
* Edward vs my lap: marginal advantage for him in S2 and S3, but he and Ronny take 0.200s on me in S1. I don't carry enough speed through the higshpeed T1-T2-T3 turns. 
* In S2, we are all very close. 
* In T8, I go earlier to 4th than Ronny and Edward, but it doesn't seem to disadvantage me. 

[b][u] Turn by turn [/u][/b]

T1: 4th gear, no braking, just a short lift after turn in, before you hit the inside curb. Once you arrive at the curb, you should be back to full power. 

T2: stay in 5th gear, no braking, avoid to go too far to the outside in midturn. In the middle of the turn you should be back on full power. Use all the road available on exit. 

T3: slight braking, and downshift to 4th gear; hug the inside curb and go back to full power where the curb ends. At the exit of this turn, the shorter way is the fastest. If you go too early on power and go wide to the left side of the track, you do more distance and you lose time. 

T4, full speed in 5th, make sure your car is stable at exit when you brake for T5. 

T5-6. This is the heaviest braking of the lap. Consider it as 1 double apex turn, taken in 3d gear. Your brake power should decrease when you come to the first apex. After midturn, gently come back on throttle and focus on exit speed. Due to elevation changes, be aware of bottoming. Images say more than words, so study the Moss passage in our replays 

T7: full speed, you should already be in 4th here 

T8: another high speed lift-without-braking turn. Between T8 and T9, you should downshift to 4th. Consider exit as a compromise turn, that should put you at the extreme right of the track to approach T9 

T9: 4th gear, slight braking, compromise turn, that must place you in the best possible position for T10 
EDIT: it is possible not to brake, but braking is safer. 

T10: with this weather, 4th gear. Edward and I brake, Ronny doesn't and he is faster in this sector. Be careful not to go back on throttle to soon. Careful also with the inside curb. If you destabilize the car, you risk to spin and to wreck
