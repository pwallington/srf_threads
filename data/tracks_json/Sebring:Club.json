  "TRACK_NOTES": "Courtesy of Daniil M [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3483276.page#9816140](link)[/url]\n[list]For T6 I line-up a tree and colored boards on the barriers for a braking marker.  Exact board will depend on individual FOV.  [/list]\n[list]Fighting for position here is super-costly, so pick your battles[/list]\n[list]If you're <0.3s behind someone equally-paced coming out of T8 (maybe 0.4s with a strong western wind), you'll be close enough to attack.  Otherwise, you'd probably be only close enough for a desperate dive from several car lengths back.[/list]\n[list]On the last lap, if the car in front defends the hairpin and you give up a bit under braking to take the normal line and accelerate early, you have a 50-50 shot at passing them at the line.[/list]\n[list]If someone's on your rear bumper, they'd be tempted to stick their's nose on the inside in T5 and T8. Just be prepared/practice the outside line.  [/list]"
