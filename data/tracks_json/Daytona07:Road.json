  "PREAMBLE": "Welcome to The 'historic' (and free!) 2007 rendition of Daytona Speedway. The road course at this iconic 2.5-mile oval is a regular host of SCCA Majors and Runoffs for the real-life Spec Racers, now it's your chance to follow their example. This track has a lot of high-speed draft sections around the banked oval, making tight pack racing a guarantee, and strategy a must!\n\n[b][u]N.B.: Please read important note below about NOT running on the apron below the banked corners![/u][/b]",
  "TRACK_NOTES": "This track is new to the official iRacing SRF series, but well known to real-life SRF racing. No notes yet except this very important PSA...\n\n[color=red][b]IMPORTANT:[/b][/color]The painted line at the bottom of the banking defines the edge of the 'racing surface', according to iRacing staff[1]. Do not run below this line attempting to 'shortcut' the corners. Even though you will not get a 1x this *is* a protestable violation of the Sporting Code.\n\n[1]: Confirmed by Nim Cross here:\n[youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ooQQxP3u8A[/youtube]\n\n"
