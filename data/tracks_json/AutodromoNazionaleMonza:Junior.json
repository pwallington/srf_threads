  "PREAMBLE": "Welcome to Monza Junior! This is a new track to the SRF rotation, the short 'Junior' layout of the famous Monza racetrack. This layout uses an infield track link to cut across from the start-finish straight to rejoin the track just after the Ascari chicane, with drivers heading down the back straight to the Parabolica before starting another lap. Short laps with only a few turns will likely make for some hectic racing - don't get dizzy!",
