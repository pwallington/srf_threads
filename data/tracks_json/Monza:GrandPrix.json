  "PREAMBLE": "Welcome To Monza! For the first time ever, the Spec Racer Ford visits the historic Italian Grand Prix track. Get ready for epic draft battles, because this track is known for its long high speed straights, and tight chicanes. Remember, sometimes winning the battle will cost you the war - risky overtaking maneuvers might end up costing you the race, so choose your moment carefully.",
  "TRACK_NOTES": "This is a brand new track for the Spec Racer, so there's no notes yet, but the usual draft track advice applies - don't take unnecessary risks, especially early in the race. It would be a shame to ruin your race as well as someone else's! In particular, the first chicane on the first lap is a well known trouble spot - use EXTRA caution here."
