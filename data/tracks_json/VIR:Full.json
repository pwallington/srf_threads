  "PREAMBLE": "This week we are at VIR. But unusually we are racing the very long full course that is not often run by the smaller SRF. 12 laps of this mighty track combining the long long straights with the tight twisty sections will definitely make for some awesome racing and draft fests. Expect many casualties especially on the last corner. Plenty of opportunities to overtake and enjoy yourselves. \n\n[b]Participation will not be high. Do your best to help the series out and show up on track.\n Do not wait for others to register for a race before you do; show that you are available and others will follow.\n There is nothing worse than having 12 drivers not registering for a race because they individually think that nobody else is around.[/b]",
  "TRACK_NOTES": "No notes yet. The main advice here is to stay on track. You will gain places and finish high just by driving a consistent, error-free race. \n Drivers will mainly attack each other in the start/finish and back straights. \n"
