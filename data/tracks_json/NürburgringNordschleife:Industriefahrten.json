  "PREAMBLE": "This week we travel to the famous 'Green Hell' - Nurburgring Nordschleife. This is the industriefahrten layout - i.e. NOT including the GP track.\n[size=18][color=red][b]IMPORTANT NOTES THIS WEEK[/b][/color][/size]\n\t- There are [b]separate qualifying sessions[/b] (starting 15 minutes past each hour), not the normal attached qualifying!\n\t- The track takes a LONG time to load on most PCs - be aware of this and join the race session in plenty of time!\n\t- We only have 3 laps in the race - survival is paramount because a tow back to the pits will basically end your race. Concentrate on being clean and safe and you will get a good result.\n\t- Static weather for all sessions this week - no need to worry about track temperature :)",
  "TRACK_NOTES": "Here's a turn-by-turn guide I wrote for myself last time we ran here: [url]https://gist.github.com/pwallington/7ec44ed5e9422ebf4b8a17530db6d92c[/url].\n\nSome important general notes:\n       - There are not many overtaking opportunities early on in the lap - especially on lap 1, BE PATIENT and you will have plenty of chances later on.\n       - The SRF really doesn't like the kerbs, especially on the exits of corners - be careful!\n       - The relatively low power of the SRF makes many of the faster corners easy flat-out or with a small lift"
