  "PREAMBLE": "This week we head to Detroit and the new-to-iRacing Belle Isle track. A classic track in American motorsports, Belle Isle hosts a variety or racing formats but most notably the IndyCar Detroit Grand Prix. A tight, technical, bumpy street circuit with few if any runoffs - this will be a challenging and punishing venue to race at! This is the first SRF visit to the track, so leave your thoughts, impressions, notes and questions below!",
