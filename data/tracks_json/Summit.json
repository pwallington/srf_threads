  "PREAMBLE": "For week #WEEK_NUM# we're at the venerable Summit Point Raceway. This popular free track provides a great blend of drafting opportunities on the main straight, bravery-testing high speed corners and a slower technical section, making for great racing well suited to the pace of the SRF.",
  "TRACK_NOTES": "[i]Track notes courtesy of Luca Varani[/i]\nThere are some dangerous spots at Summit; being careful in a couple of places will provide great racing everywhere else.\nThe video track guides will show you how to drive a lap. The notes below are mainly concerned with race tactics and are mainly intended for drivers with less experience.\n\n[u][i]Turn 1 Right - [/i][/u]\nThis is the best overtaking opportunity in the lap.\nHowever, it can be really messy at race start with many cars diving into a tight corner after heavy braking. Don't take risks: the race is long and it would be a pity to spoil it for everyone on the very first corner.\n\nFirst lap aside, you can attack under braking both on the inside and outside entering this corner. Passing on the outside is obviously more difficult, but on exit you will find yourself on the inside for the following corners, allowing to complete a pass initiated at the hairpin.\n\nDo not dive bomb. The general idea is that you should attack another driver only if you have established significant overlap at turn in.\n\n[u][i]Turn 3 Left -  [/i][/u]\nA fast, difficult, left hander that tends to bring cars onto the sand trap.\nThis is not a passing spot. Side by side here should be avoided as it requires great car control by all involved.\nMany crashes happen here; be careful.\n\n[u][i]Turn 5 left - [/i][/u]\nAnother dangerous spot where passing attempts are better avoided.\nHeavy braking with the car weight still being transferred from the previous corner can be disastrous.\nGoing side by side is difficult because the cars will drift wide from the right hander just before the braking zone. You might also be taken by surprise by early braking from the car in front. Just be careful and don't be ashamed to lift.\n\n[u][i]Turn 6 to Turn 9 - [/i][/u]\nThis series of tight corners is important for the laptime but is too narrow to allow any passing opportunity.\n\n[u][i]Turn 10 right - [/i][/u]\nThe final corner of the track, attacking here is a waste of time, unless it is the very last corner of the race.\nIf you go side by side in this corner both cars will loose a lot of speed and struggle for the whole main straight.\nBy contrast, concentrate on getting a good exit from T10R and you will be able to attack on the straight with the help of the draft."
