  "PREAMBLE": "This week head to the legacy '2016' version of Charlotte Motor Speedway's \"Road\" layout. A combination of the twisty infield with a challenging uphill corner, and 3/4 of the full oval makes for great racing. The strong draft around the oval section will lead to a lot of last-lap strategy - do you wait behind the leader to pass on the oval, or try to lead out the whole last lap?",
  "TRACK_NOTES": "[color=red][b]IMPORTANT:[/b][/color] The pit lane exits [i]directly[/i] onto the inside of turn one! PLEASE make sure to check for oncoming traffic before exiting the pits!\n[youtube]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlYIqRIuS3s[/youtube]\n\n[color=red][b]IMPORTANT:[/b][/color]The white line at the bottom of the banking defines the edge of the 'racing surface', according to iRacing staff. [b]Do not run below this line[/b] attempting to 'shortcut' the corners. Even though you will not get a 1x this *is* a protestable violation of the Sporting Code.\n"
