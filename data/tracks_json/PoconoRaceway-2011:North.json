  "PREAMBLE": "Welcome to Pocono! This is a new track to the SRF rotation, the newly-free 2011 version of the famous Pocono raceway. This time we are using the 'North' layout, which uses a lot of infield and hardly any of the oval segments. A short and winding track, but several corners lack good sighting points, so take care when learning it.",
