  "PREAMBLE": "This week we head 'down under' to Oran Park Raceway. Mapped by iRacing shortly before it's demolition in 2010, this historic circuit was well known for v8 Supercars racing, and now lives on forever in iRacing. We're using the longest \"Grand Prix\" layout, which comprises 12 turns over 1.6 mils, including the crossover bridge which makes it one of the few 'figure-8' tracks available.",
  "TRACK_NOTES": "None yet, just watch out for Turn 4!"
