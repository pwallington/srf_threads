PREAMBLE : For week #WEEK_NUM# we're off to England's famous Brands Hatch track at the Grand Prix layout. With it's stunning scenery and undulating track it makes for spectacular racing. For the newbies - check out the lap guides, you can easily gain seconds per lap knowing which corners you can/should cut.
TRACK_NOTES : \
A fast and exhilarating track that many have grown to love or hate. There are not that many overtaking places here, so be patient, keep the tyres black side down and get the draft on the back straight for the best passing opportunities. This is also the best place to ease up and let faster cars by. T4 is the main corner here and the most difficult for achieving a good lap time. Learning also where the run off's are, which corners you can cut without incidents will shave 2 - 3 seconds from your lap time rather than running within the track lines / tarmac. Brands Hatch is very generous with its of road limits, so use them to your advantage as the fast guys will be. 

[b][u]T1[/u][/b] Spin / Crash Corner 
One of the most difficult corners on the track to get right and very easy to mess this one up as it is a blind turn in. Mistakes here will cost dearly and be on the look out for yellow flags. It is important to get your braking down and the car balanced and in the right gear before you're turn in otherwise the gradient changes will spin the back end around on you. 

Find your braking and turn in point are critical here so study the video carefully and make use of the marshall's hut as a guidance. Some curb on the exit can be taken, but don't take too much otherwise a spin across the track or into the gravel will be waiting for you. 

It is important to get your braking down and the car balanced and in the right gear before you're turn in otherwise the gradient changes will spin the back end around on you. 

[b][u]T2[/u][/b] Overtake 
2nd gear (some may like 3rd). Hard braking just past the 50 board and get straight into the curb, hug the curb and balance the power, naturally the car will move to the outside of the track and let it do it accelerating, changing into 3rd if not already and using all of the track to the left. This is a long corner, be patient with it and with time this becomes easy 

[b][u]T3[/u][/b]
Get out as far right as you can and 50m get your braking done. Spot your apex and there is plenty of run off on the exit, make use of it to get maximum corner speed and good lap times 

[b][u]T4[/u][/b] Overtake 
The trick I find with this corner is to square it off. Watch the video. Keep right and go deep into the corner. When you think you should be turning, don't keep going another 20 - 40 metres as if you are missing the corner. Get some braking done, then turn into left curbing and power through the corner. The corner opens up allowing some good run off, use it to power up the hill. This corner is one of the most difficult and is critical to a good lap time as you are now approaching the fastest part of the track. 

[b][u]T5[/u][/b]
Just past the 50m board, slight tap of the brakes, balance the car, pick the apex and keep a constant throttle and use the throttle to steer this fast 4th gear corner. Try not to drop wheels on the grass on exit. 

[b][u]T6[/u][/b] Cut 
Again 50m board or where the track has light colour marks on the left hand side. Get it into 3rd with some positive braking and attack the apex. You can take quite a bit of a cut out of the apex here without an off track violation and this corner can be done a lot faster than you think. 

[b][u]T7[/u][/b] Cut Crash / Off Track / Spin 
Another unsighted corner that catches a lot of people out and can be done a lot faster by cutting the apex with a generous allowance for off track. As you hit the rise of the hill, on the left hand side, positive braking into 3rd and cut that bad boy curb / apex. With practice you will find the tolerances allowed for the off track and will be taking this corner with speed. 

[b][u]T8[/u][/b] Spin 
Deceptively easy, but catches many out. Some like 4th, some like 3rd for the control. Either way, don't get sucked into this corner. Get the speed down and take it easy until you understand the speed you an take through T8. You may find 4th gear with light braking helps balance the car more, try both methods and make sure you hit the left apex. Watch out for wheels off on the right hand side as this will result in a spin 

[b][u]T9[/u][/b] Spin 
On the left hand side, where the service road meets the track is your braking point for this 4th gear corner. Watch this corner as it sucks you in and is tighter at the beginning than you think. Get the braking done early, give it longer than you expect for the apex before powering out. Get on the power too early and you will run wide, or have to ease off and loose momentum on the straight ahead and hence loss time.
