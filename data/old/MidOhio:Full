PREAMBLE : For week #WEEK_NUM# we travel to Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course. This track is home to many racing events including the real-life SRF SCCA runoffs  and provides excellent racing. With several overtaking opportunities and the challenging 'Madness' section winding through the mid-half of the lap, battles are fierce here, with attempted passes often resulting in half a lap or more of side-by-side action.
TRACK_NOTES : \
[u][i]Turn 1 left [/i][/u]
A fast corner that can punish you if you get it wrong. If you cut too much on the inside the curb can launch your car and make you spin. There is also a black flag waiting for you if you pass the curb and put too much car in the exit lane from the pits.
On corner exit you will tend to drift wide other the curb. Hitting the grass with the steering wheel not straight is likely to send you spinning.

T1L is not a passing place. You will be tempted to attack here after getting a nice draft on the start finish straight: don't do it. Side by side here will, at best, cost both cars a lot of time. At worst it will cause a crash.

[u][i]Turn 2 Right - Keyhole [/i][/u]
Getting a good exit is paramount because you will carry the speed all the way through the longest straight of the track.
Hard braking into this hairpin offers passing opportunities, but it is up to you to decide if you want to do it or not.
Two main choices: attack here, go side by side in the hairpin and hope you can hang on to the lead in the following straight.
Do not make the pass here, concentrate on a great exit, use the draft and pass after the corner.

[u][i]Turn 4 right - China beach[/i][/u]
Main passing spot on the track.
You can attack under braking both on the inside, getting the shorter line closer to the apex, and on the outside, which will give you the inside for T5L that follows shortly.
Just avoid dive bombing, leave room to the other car and everything will be fine.
Epic side by side battles start here and often carry on for several corners.

[u][i]Turn 5 left - [/i][/u]
You will drive over a crest while turning, it is not difficult to loose the car here.
Despite this, overtakes initiated at T4 will often finish in this corner. If you find yourself on the outside just be careful: the car has a tendency to drift wide off track. On the other hand, if you cut towards the inside you will likely collide with a car beside you.
Similarly, if you are on the inside with a car beside you lift to avoid drifting wide into it.

[u][i]Turn 6 right - [/i][/u]
This is a difficult corner and not a passing place.
The racing line is narrow; side by side here is suicidal: you will get contact or loose a lot of time, really a lot.

[u][i]Turn 9 right - towards Thunder valley[/i][/u]
Another corner where you will be tempted to attack but where you should not do it, as a general rule.
Another corner where you will have to deal with elevation changes, the entry is fast and the exit carries you wide. Not worth attempting a pass here in most circumstances.

[u][i]Turn 11 left - [/i][/u]
Fast corner; you will have to hit the curb on the inside and exit on the grass edge. It is a great corner to drive on your own, it is not a place where you want to attack unless, maybe, it is the last lap of the race and the car ahead is slower than usual.
Should you get into side by side action, you must slow down a lot, probably dropping a gear, or you will drift wide and collide.

[u][i]Turn 12 right - Carousel[/i][/u]
People take different lines approaching this corner. Many drivers choose a wide entry and then cut towards the apex. Drivers behind are tempted to attack on the inside, entering a gap which is actually not real and will suddenly close.
Contact is common on this corner. Don't be ashamed to lift, tuck behind your opponent and get ready to pass in the long straights at the beginning of the following lap, before and after T2R.
