PREAMBLE : Welcome to the world-famous Suzuka International Circuit - home to some fantasitc Grand Prix racing over many years. This track makes for some great SRF racing, so it's definitely worth the effort to learn it!

[u][i]Turn 1 Right - [/i][/u]
One of the main passing spots, the risk is causing contact when the corner tightens for the T2R entry.
Use the draft on the main straight for a clean pass, just be careful to allow plenty of room for side by side into the corner itself.

[u][i] Turn 3 Left to Turn 7 left [/i][/u]
The esses are not overtaking places. Side by side racing initiated in Turn 2 can be prolonged here, but passing is better not initiated in the middle of these complicated esses.

[u][i] Turn 9 Right, Degner[/i][/u]
Another difficult corner with a very narrow line. Exiting wide can launch your car on the curb and spin you.
It's better not to attempt a pass here.

[u][i] Turn 11 Left , Hairpin[/i][/u]
Heavy braking for the hairpin may allow attacking on both inside and, more difficult, outside.
Just be careful: passing must be initiated around Turn10, where cars can drift wide and leave no room for others.

[u][i] Turn 13 Left , Spoon[/i][/u]
You might be tempted to attack here after getting a good draft on the straight following the hairpin (actually a very long sweeper, but it's easily flat out in the SRF). Navigating Spoon corner with a car alongside you is far from easy, however, so be extra careful and wait for a better passing opportunity if you can afford it.

[u][i] Turn 14 Left , 130R[/i][/u]
Similarly to the above, the draft on the straight can tempt you. This corner, however, should not be taken side by side. The chances of running into each other (or pushing somebody off track) are really high. Both drivers will need to slow down a lot to allow side by side racing here.

[u][i] Turn 15-16 , Chicane[/i][/u]
Another passing opportunity when braking for the chicane. It's better to attempt here than in 130R, just be careful not to dive bomb or cut into another car in the narrow right/left racing line.

Overall, passing is not that easy on this track. Be patient and play your chances right, though, and you will have some wonderful racing.
