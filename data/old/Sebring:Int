PREAMBLE : This week we head to Florida for the full "International" layout of Sebring Raceway. This is a technical and bumpy track that is particularly taxing for those running strong force feedback! However, with the strong draft and good overtaking opportunities it can provide close and exciting racing.
TRACK_NOTES : \
Thanks to Daniil Manaenkov and Ignacio Hernandez-Ros for notes inputs!

[b][u]Turn 1 Left:[/u][/b]
The brake point and proper speed for turn 1 is critical for this fast 4th gear corner. You can use the kerb on exit, but be careful of the dirt outside. Also watch out for slower cars rejoining the track from the pit exit here.

[b][u]Turn 3 & 4: [/u][/b]
This looks like a place to attack but the line through the right/left of this section is narrow and the apex kerbs will send your car flying offtrack. Going side-by-side is likely to slow both cars down greatly. People will be tempted to put their nose inside you here if they're close enough so practice approaching these corners from off the usual line. 

[b][u]Turn 5 left:[/u][/b]
Another corner where (a) people will be tempted to attack and (b) it isn't really a good idea. The line is a late apex so an apparent gap on the inside will close quickly. Instead, concentrate on getting a good exit to use the draft coming up - if your gap is < 0.3 seconds you have a great shot at attacking on the following corner.

[b][u]T7 right, "Hairpin":[/u][/b]
Finishing a pass with the draft from the straight is likely here, but watch out for an over/under defense if you take the inside line. If the car in front defends to the inside it's even possible to get a faster exit by giving up some ground under braking, putting you on the inside for the run up to T10R. Watch out for the kink at the exit - it's easy to underestimate the space available.

[b][u]Turn 10 right, "Cunningham":[/u][/b]
With a good exit from the hairpin this also becomes a place you could attack, but it is easy to defend from the outside line into the closely following T11 Left "Collier".

[b][u] Turn 13 right, "Tower":[/u][/b]
As with T3/T5, people will be tempted to attack under braking here, but side-by-side battles through this corner will be very costly. Practice taking different lines through this corner to survive badly-timed attacks!

[b][u]Turns 14, 15, 16 - Bishop, Gendebien & Le Mans [/u][/b]
The kerb on the exit of T15R can bottom out the car and send you spinning into the wall. The exit of T16 is a critical part of the track for lap times and overtaking possibilities. Prepare to get on the throttle as early as possible, and use all the kerb on both sides! Obviously, with the huge draft following on the Ullman straight it's not wise to go side-by-side through T16 as you will lose a lot of time to the other cars around you.

[b][u]Turn 17 Right, Sunset Bend [/u][/b]
On the Modified course this is a good overtaking opportunity, but on this layout the tightening radius and curved braking zone make this a difficult corner with several possible lines. Be prepared to go through here 2 wide, and be careful to avoid dive-bombing in the tricky braking zone!
