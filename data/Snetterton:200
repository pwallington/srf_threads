PREAMBLE : Welcome to week #WEEK_NUM# at the brand new Snetterton 200 circuit! This track offers a lot of interesting new corners, and plenty of straights for attacking with the draft - get ready for some excellent exciting racing.\n[b]N.B.:[/b] As this track is brand new to the iRacing service please take the time to learn the track properly and avoid accidents. In particular Nelson (Turn 5) and Murrays (Turn 9) involve rapid and mostly unsighted changes in direction and are easy to get very wrong!
