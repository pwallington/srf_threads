PREAMBLE : Welcome to Pocono! This is a brand new track to the SRF rotation, the newly-free 2011 version of the famous Pocono raceway. To start with we are trying the winding 'East' layout, which uses a lot of infield and hardly any of the oval segments. A short and winding track, but several corners lack good sighting points, so take care when learning it.
