[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series @ [b] Charlotte Road [/b]
Week 8 of 12 - 2016 Season 2[/size][/color]
Race Distance: 18 laps, approximately 25 minutes
  
This week we back stateside to Charlotte Motor Speedway's "Road" layout. A combination of the twisty infield with a challenging uphill corner, and 3/4 of the full oval makes for great racing. The strong draft around the oval section will lead to a lot of last-lap strategy - do you wait to pass on the oval, or try to lead out the whole lap?

[size=18][b]USEFUL INFO FOR NEWCOMERS[/b][/size]
(Suggestions/improvements to this reference info are always appreciated!)

You can complete a full 8 week season by acquiring [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3288130.page]only 3 paid tracks[/url], if you don't have any.

The recently updated [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3475225.page]baseline setup[/url] is an excellent starting point for any driver.

N.B. The weather settings are random in each session. There is no point comparing laptimes from different servers.
