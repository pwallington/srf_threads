[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series @ [b] Sebring Club [/b]
Week 11 of 12 - 2016 Season 2[/size][/color]
Race Distance: 20 laps, approximately 26-28 minutes
  
Welcome back to Sebring! This week we race the other half of the track, on the 'Club' layout. Next season we'll be running the international layout combining this with the 'Modified' layout section from week 6. This short layout contains plenty of interesting corners and a couple of strong overtaking opportunities, making for great racing.

Last time we ran this track (in 2015), there were issues with the relative box when exiting the pitlane - PLEASE CHECK YOUR MIRRORS before joining the racing line!!

[size=18][b]USEFUL INFO FOR NEWCOMERS[/b][/size]
(Suggestions/improvements to this reference info are always appreciated!)

Read this first: [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/2022116.page] Zen and the Art of the Spec Racer Ford [/url]

The recently updated [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3475225.page]baseline setup[/url] is an excellent starting point for any driver.

You can complete a full 8 week season by acquiring [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3288130.page]only 3 paid tracks[/url], if you don't have any.

N.B. The weather settings are random in each session. There is no point comparing laptimes from different servers.
