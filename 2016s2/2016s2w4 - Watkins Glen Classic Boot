[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series, [b] Watkins Glen Classic Boot - Week 4[/b] of 12 - 2016 Season 2[/size][/color]

[i]Welcome to the SRF.
We pride ourselves on a friendly, competitive and yet relaxed atmosphere both on- and off-track.
As a reminder, you can complete a full 8 weeks season just by acquiring 3 paid tracks, if you don't have any.

Don't be ashamed to ask for help, either in practice sessions or on the forum. 
The weather settings are different in each session. No point comparing laptimes from different servers.[/i]

Race Distance: 12 laps, approximately 25 minutes


[b]TRACK NOTES[/b]
Watkins Glen is a draft track, which leads to very exciting battles but can also end in tears. 
Just be patient, don't take unnecessary risks and you will be rewarded with 25 minutes of close racing.

[u][i]Turn 1 right : the 90[/i][/u]
A difficult corner. The curb can spin your car if it is too low. You can take some of it, but not much.
There is a generous run off that can be used without 1x, if necessary.
Having a good exit is paramount since you will have to carry the speed uphill with full throttle until the Carousel
Overtakes here are possible but not recommended: both cars will be slowed down and struggle in the uphill section.

[u][i]Turn 5 right, Carousel [/i][/u]
The main overtaking spot in this configuration. Draft on the back straight and attack at the Carousel, after light braking. You can make it stick both on the inside and outside and experienced drivers can even remain 3 wide through the corner. Do not attempt to do so unless both you and the drivers alongside are very confident with the SRF.

[u][i]Turn 6 Left, Chute[/i][/u]
Side by side is possible but, again, requires good control and usually doesn't achieve much. Passes initiated in turn 5 might be completed here, otherwise it is better not to attack.
If you really are faster than the car ahead, it is usually better to wait for:

[u][i]Turn 7 right, Toe[/i][/u]
A good exit from T6L will allow to move alongside the car ahead of you and challenge it under braking.
Drivers are tempted to dive bomb here: don't do it.
Exit from T7R is important to get a good speed uphill, towards turn 8.

[u][i]Turn 8 right, Boot[/i][/u]
Another good overtaking spot if you have a great exit from T7R.
Move to the inside and attack under braking. Again, avoid dive bombing.
It's a slow corner but it's easy to drift wide. Be careful not to cause contacts with the cars you are trying to pass.

[u][i]Turn 9 left[/i][/u]
Another slow corner where passing is possible.
Many drivers take a late apex, do not think that there is a gap you can exploit to pass: it will close and lead to contact.
You need to be well alongside another car to show your intention to attack here.
Drifting wide on exit will bring you against the wall, be careful.

[u][i]Turn 10 left and turn 11 right[/i][/u]
Two fast corners, the first one may require no braking depending on the weather.
It is easy to loose control here, especially by running over the curbs with the steering wheel at the wrong angle.
There are often cars spinning into the gravel outside T10L or against the wall exiting T11R.
These are not passing places, it's just too risky. Side by side racing here requires utmost trust in the cars around you and very good car control.

[b]TRACK FAMILIARISATION[/b]

Excellent track guide by Kevin Browne. It's the chicane version but otherwise the track is identical.
