[size=18][b]TRACK NOTES[/b][/size]
These track notes deal with overtaking and race tactics. The demo laps will show how to drive around the track.
The notes are mainly meant as a guideline for less experienced drivers. They are general observations but, of course, every race situation is different.
[i] Please feel free to provide corrections or improvements to these notes - they will all be welcomed![/i] :)
[with thanks to Ignacio Hernandez-Ros - adapted from his 2015 S2 notes]

 [u][i]Turn 1 Left[/i][/u]
The brake point and proper speed for turn 1 is critical. Avoid the outside kerb after T1, and get back over to the left for the entrance to T2, which is coming up fast. 

 [u][i]Turn 2 & 3 Right[/i][/u]
Brake early and keep 3rd gear for T2 and T3. Use the inside kerb of T2 but be very careful with the kerb exiting T3. From here to the end of the lap the kerbs are not a problem (and are essential for a good lap time!).

 [u][i]Turns 4-7, Bishop, Gendebien, Le Mans[/i][/u]
3rd gear all the way through (maybe 4th in particularly cold weather) and use all the kerbs. Do not lift off the throttle completely, to keep the car settled. The exit of T7 is the most critical part of the track for lap times and overtaking possibilities. Prepare to get on the throttle as early as possible, and use all the kerb!

 [u][i]Turns 8 & 9 Right, Sunset Bend[/i][/u]
This is one of the main overtaiking opportunities with the draft from the Ullman Straight. Be prepared to go through here 2 wide, and be careful to avoid dive-bombing! Learn the braking point - braking properly here is key to success. The track is edged by walls here, take care not to push yourself (or another car!) out into them.

[size=18][b]USEFUL INFO FOR NEWCOMERS[/b][/size]
(Suggestions/improvements to this reference info are always appreciated!)

You can complete a full 8 week season by acquiring [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3288130.page]only 3 paid tracks[/url], if you don't have any.

The recently updated [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3475225.page]baseline setup[/url] is an excellent starting point for any driver.

N.B. The weather settings are random in each session. There is no point comparing laptimes from different servers.
