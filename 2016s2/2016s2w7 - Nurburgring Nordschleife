[size=18][color=red][b]IMPORTANT NOTES THIS WEEK[/b][/color][/size]
	- There will be separate qualifying sessions, not the attached qualifying that we normally have!
	- The track takes a LONG time to load on most PCs - be aware of this and join the race session in plenty of time!
	- We only have 3 laps in the race - survival is paramount because a tow back to the pits will basically end your race. Concentrate on being clean and safe and you will get a good result.

[size=18][b]TRACK NOTES[/b][/size]
  [i]What... you really thought I'd write up a turn-by-turn guide for the whole Nordschleife?![/i] :D

Fortunately there are many great lap guides available online - reply below with your favorites!

Regardless, some important notes:
       - There are not many overtaking opportunities early on in the lap - especially on lap 1, BE PATIENT and you will have plenty of chances later on.
       - The SRF really doesn't like the kerbs, especially on the exits of corners - be careful!
       - The relatively low power of the SRF makes many of the faster corners easy flat-out with a small lift.

Daniil has posted a very safe and easy-to-drive setup [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/200/3349192.page#9443179]HERE[/url] (also attached to this post). It understeers quite a lot, but it is easy to drive fast and is friendlier over the kerbs than the baseline.

[size=18][b]USEFUL INFO FOR NEWCOMERS[/b][/size]
(Suggestions/improvements to this reference info are always appreciated!)

You can complete a full 8 week season by acquiring [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3288130.page]only 3 paid tracks[/url], if you don't have any.

The recently updated [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3475225.page]baseline setup[/url] is an excellent starting point for any driver.

N.B. The weather settings are random in each session. There is no point comparing laptimes from different servers.
