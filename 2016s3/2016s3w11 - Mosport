Race Distance: 15 laps, approximately 25 minutes

The penultimate week of Season 3 brings us to Canadian Tire Motorsports Park, known affectionately as "MoSport" (pronounced "moe-sport"). This is a fast, flowing track with a strong draft and some tricky corners, making for great racing but also some huge crashes.

(Suggestions/improvements to this reference info are always appreciated!)

Read this first: [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/2022116.page] Zen and the Art of the Spec Racer Ford [/url]

The recently updated [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3475225.page]baseline setup[/url] is an excellent starting point for any driver.

You can complete a full 8 week season by acquiring [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3288130.page]only 3 paid tracks[/url], if you don't have any.

N.B. The weather settings are random in each session, greatly affecting lap times. Take note of the weather when comparing laptimes from different servers.
