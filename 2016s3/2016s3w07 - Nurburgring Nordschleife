[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series @ [b] Nordschleife Industriefahrten [/b]
Week 7 of 12 - 2016 Season 3[/size][/color]
Race Distance: 3 laps, approximately 25-30 minutes


This week we travel to the famous 'Green Hell' - Nurburgring Nordschleife. This is the touristfarhten layout - i.e. NOT including the GP track. This is a long and technical track, which can be intimidating without practise. However, the long track can make for some epic racing battles.

[size=18][b]IMPORTANT NOTES FOR THIS WEEK[/b][/size]
Unlike normal weeks the following are in effect:
	- Separate qualifying in which you get [b][i]ONE (1)[/b][/i] timed lap, starting from the tourist entrance. Sessions run hourly.
	- Static weather. Every session will have the same weather condidions! Likely to be 80F, 2mph @W wind, 40RH, partly cloudy (TBC).

[size=18][b]TRACK NOTES[/b][/size]

There are many 'driving guides' for the Nordschleife available online, and plenty of great info, fast lap replays etc. in last season's thread, which you can find here: http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3479409.page
BMW made an easy-to-digest guide, available here: http://www.billzilla.org/bmwring.pdf
I wrote an SRF-specific guide to help remember the later half of the lap here: https://gist.github.com/pwallington/7ec44ed5e9422ebf4b8a17530db6d92c


Regardless, some important notes:
       - There are not many overtaking opportunities early on in the lap - especially on lap 1, BE PATIENT and you will have plenty of chances later on.
       - The SRF really doesn't like the kerbs, especially on the exits of corners - be careful!
       - The relatively low power of the SRF makes many of the faster corners easy flat-out or only a small lift.

Daniil has posted a very safe and easy-to-drive setup [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/200/3349192.page#9443179]HERE[/url] (updated version also attached to this post). It understeers quite a lot, but it is easy to drive fast and is friendlier over the kerbs than the baseline. The current world record SRF laptime was run with this setup!

Rob Adams' detailed track guide to the Nordschleife: 

After the start line, you wiggle a few times before a long straight. The only corner that matters is the one before the long straight. If you try to go fast on the others, at least you haven't wasted much time and you can start again from the pits. 

The next section is long and flat out except where it isn't. The places where it isn't will kill you. 

Then you go downhill for a while. The downhill is easy and fast except where it isn't. The place where it isn't easy and fast will kill you. 

Eventually you cross a bridge. After that bridge, you go flat out for a long time, except for one place where you don't. That place will kill you. It's also dark. And scary. I think there are monsters there. 

After a long flat out run, you get to a carousel. If you get it right, it's the best thing ever. You will never get it right. 

The rest of the track is a mystery. You go up, you go down. Corners will come up when you least expect them. If you go too fast, they will kill you. If you go too slow, you will feel like a coward. I think some of the corners move around between laps. 

Eventually the track straightens out. If you got the entry to the straight right, you'll be happy. Otherwise you have a minute or so to realize that your lap time is going to suck and you just wasted 8 minutes.
