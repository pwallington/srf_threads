Merry Christmas everyone! Week 2 takes us to the historic Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, affectionately known just as "Spa". This long track makes for epic draft battles with the SRF. Strategy will be key to good results here - time your attacks carefully and plan for a close finish. Let the draft battles commence!

[color=red][b]Three important notes this week: [/b][/color]
[list]As you may already know, Spa is notoriously harsh with off-track penalties. In general the red/white kerbing is [b][color=green]OKAY[/color][/b] while green 'astroturf' outside the track is [b][color=red]NOT OKAY[/color][/b]. To get a 1x the [b]center point of the car[/b] must be over the 'off-track' surface.[/list]
[list]Due to the length of the lap there is only time for ONE qualifying lap. As the offtracks are very tight here it's recommended to be careful to post a valid time![/list]
[list]Due to the Christmas holiday the scheduling of some regular hosted/league/SoF sessions is impacted. Check the details below.[/list]

[size=18][b]TRACK NOTES[/b][/size]

[i]Preface courtesy of Luca Varani[/i]
Spa is a great track for racing thanks to the huge draft leading to race long battles.
It is, however, easy to turn excitement into despair if you are not careful.

It is important to realize that:
- There are many passing opportunities per lap, there is no reason to take any risk. Pass only when it is safe to do so.
- The draft will give you a lot of speed, but this doesn't mean that you are obliged to keep that foot on the gas. Lifting to avoid troubles is a smart thing to do. Everybody can smash the throttle, force a 3 wide and cause a crash. It takes courage to lift and wait for a better opportunity.
- Prolonged side by side battles in corners will slow everyone down. Decide if this is the tactic you want to use. It is often faster to sit behind another car for part of the track.
- You will reach the corners with higher speed due to the draft. You need to adjust your braking and entry to avoid losing control.
- Remember that voluntarily taking advantages of 1x is unsportmanlike and against the sporting code!

[u][b]T1 Eau Rouge[/b][/u] The bottom of the most famous sequences of corners in Motorsport. This quick left before the uphill Raidillon is crucial to the track as Maximising exit speed throughout this flat out section is of paramount importance. Just like Lime Rock Park the uphill here out of Eau Rouge and into Raidillion can ruin your race if you aren’t careful. Very easy to bottom out. 

[u][b]T2/3 Raidillon[/b][/u] in which keeping the car within the boundaries of the track is important as it naturally wants to jump over the inside kerb which will leave you with a nasty slow down all the way down the Kemmel straight. 
Kemmel Straight – It is long enough for double overtakes to happen if the original passer makes the move early enough. If you are within about 7 tenths of a second then a pass should be made pretty easily if you can get a good run out of Eau Rouge/Raidillon 

[u][b]T5/6/7 Les Combes[/b][/u] Coming into Les Combes you will be near terminal velocity in the cars coming into a single line series of compromised corners. This will mean that going side by side will be very costly. From previous experience the raised kerbs can be an issue here if not attacked properly at a shallow enough angle. It is a quick throw into the right hand corner before dragging the car onto the left hand corner where you will compromise the exit off to get the desired line out of the Les Combes Complex. 

[u][b]T8 Rivage[/b][/u] This 180 degree hairpin that is down hill will be the hardest corner on this track for anyone new to the SRF. It is a sort of worst case scenario, Downhill means harder to brake yet you need throttle on to stabilise the car from spinning out, The Solution. Brake and throttle at the same time. Balance the two together with the steering wheel and all should be good. The exit doesn’t need compromising here as you should have enough time to get back to the right hand side of the track for no name corner. 

[u][b]T9 No Name Corner[/b][/u] This corner requires you to abuse iRacings track limits system. Get all up on the kerb on the inside and push it towards the green astro on the outside but don’t touch it. This is one of Spas famous 1x spots. This corner just requires a little lift and a dab of brake as you exit at such a low speed from the previous corner of Brussles. 

[u][b]T10 Pouhon[/b][/u] The most fun corner on the track when done correctly yet can be frustrating. This double apex left hand corner requires you to be on the lookout for a Marshall hut on your right for braking and you have to maintain throttle all of the way throughout the first section of this to stop any oversteer as you have just pitched the car into the first half of the fun. Once the car rolls out to the middle kerb or what I think as the apex kerb you want to be back in the loud pedal and pointing back towards the 2nd apex. Watch out there is a bump in the middle of the track which may cause issue if you are on the outside two wide around this corner. 

[u][b]T11 Campus[/b][/u] This high speed switchback esses section requires delicate control through the first part to open up the second. Once again the raised kerbs if attacked correctly will open up this section and with a flat exit kerb make sure to use all of it. Make sure to stick to the right hand side of the first corner here so you can exit out and allow the car to take the preferred line through the left hander of T12 

[u][b]T13 Stavelot[/b][/u] This corner is quite important to the track as it leads to the joint most important on the track. You need to make sure to take a late apex and get right up on the exit kerb on this one line only corner as going two wide here will kill your speed from here to the final chicane. 

[u][b]T14 Paul Frere[/b][/u] Coming from the exit kerb of Stavelot you need to just lift out the gas to make sure that you do not run out wide over the exit kerb as it is very strict on the off track rules. Ensure that you remain in that lane and keep the throttle floored right to the entry to the chicane. 

[u][b]T15 Blanchimont[/b][/u] Go two wide there at your own risk. It’s a flat out kink but like Eau Rouge/Raidillon it makes more sense to wait until after the kink and attack down into the final chicane. 

[u][b]T16/17 Chicane[/b][/u] The typical F1 chicane, Huge sausage kerbs so stay on the non raised kerbing and make sure that you do not divebomb the car in front. With this being the last chance saloon, getting a good exit here can make or break a lap as it is possibly the last chance to overtake in a race. You compromise the first right hand corner for the second left turn and ensure that you do not run out wide over the astroturf. You are allowed to look at it but that even costs 0.5x 

[u][b]T18 La Source[/b][/u] This the typical T1 to a Belgian GP is what we are using as the last turn this week. Many drivers will be taking a wide late apex line so do not confuse that with someone running wide. Once again like usual at Spa don’t even think about using the astroturf on the outside if you care about your precious SR.
