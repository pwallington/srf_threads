[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series @ [b] Circuit de 24hrs Le Mans[/b]
Week 5 of 12 - 2017 Season 4 [/size][/color]
Race Distance: [b]5 laps[/b], approximately 25 minutes
World Record lap time: [b]n/a[/b] by None Yet!
(n.b. random/dynamic weather impacts lap times greatly)

Welcome to a brad new iRacing track, and a piece of motorsport legend, Circuit 24 Heures du Mans. This track is HUGE, and the long straights with the strong draft will make for very close racing. Watch out for fighting for position in corners where you'll lose exit speed onto a long straight, because you'll suddenly be swapmed by everyone behind you!

Target "planned" SoF race is usually 20:45 GMT Sunday, immediately following the Weekend Warriors league race.

You can complete a full 8 week season by acquiring [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3288130.page]only 3 paid tracks[/url], if you don't have any.

N.B. The weather settings are random in each session, greatly affecting lap times. Take note of the weather when comparing laptimes from different servers.
