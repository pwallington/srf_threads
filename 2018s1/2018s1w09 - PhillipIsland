[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series @ [b] Phillip Island[/b]
Week 9 of 12 - 2018 Season 1 [/size][/color]
Race Distance: [b]15 laps[/b], approximately 25 minutes
World Record lap time: [b]1:46.526[/b] by Stoyan P Penchev (Qualifying)
(n.b. random/dynamic weather impacts lap times greatly)

This week the Spec Racer Ford Challenge travels 'down under' to Phillip Island. Located 100km south of Melbourne, this flowing track is popular with V8 supercars and superbikes alike, and makes for great intense racing. With a mix of fast sweeping corners and sharp hairpins the track can be somewhat hectic in a faster car, but suits the pace of the SRF well.

Target "planned" SoF race is usually 20:45 GMT Sunday, immediately following the Weekend Warriors league race.

[size=18][b]TRACK NOTES[/b][/size]

[color=red][b]WARNING:[/b][/color] The pit exit comes out onto directly onto the racing line on the entry to T1. 
[li][b]WATCH OUT[/b] for cars exiting the pits carelessly.[/li]
[li][b]CHECK F3 RELATIVE[/b] before exiting the pits, and wait for a safe time to enter the track!

[b]T1 – Overtake [/b]
A 5th gear corner to start the lap and the brake is not needed here. Get your eyes looking to the apex nice and early then turn in whilst still at full throttle. As you head towards the apex start to balance the throttle to ensure you do not run out wide or compromise yourself for T2. It is very possible you will see overtakes into T1 as you have a very long run towards it. 

[b]T2 – Crash / Spin / Waiting Game [/b]
T2 is one heck of a tricky corner to get right and you will always feel you can take more speed through here than you can. Coming out of T1 try and get your car towards the middle of the track before braking and turn in, getting down to 4th gear in the process. Trailing the brake very gently through here is a good way to go and make sure to give yourself plenty of room to get the car slowed down as the track falls away from you a little bit if you run wide. Hold the car as tight to the inside as you can and just wait and wait until the track begins to open out a little before bringing the power back in. It will take a number of laps to get the feeling for this right as it is not an easy corner. 

[b]T3 [/b]
This is a not so important kink in a car of this speed, just make sure to stay towards the left hand side and prepare yourself for T4. 

[b]T4 – Crash / Overtake / Spin / Carnage [/b]
T4 is the site of many an incident over the years in many series so treat this with respect. Using the 100m board on the left hand side as your brake marker point brake from 5th gear down to either 2nd or 3rd, for now I prefer 2nd as you will need a little extra punch out of the corner. You can lose the back end quite easily here if you don’t pay attention and the kerb on the inside can unsettle the car. Use the astro turf on the outside if necessary and swing the car through the little kink of T5 for T6 

[b]T6 – Spin [/b]
T6 is on the face of it a simple enough corner but due to the length of it, it can be tricky to find the optimal line. Use the kerb on the outside as you braking point, it’s only a slight dab and keep the car in 3rd gear. The track tightens slightly on exit so you want to take a sweeping line through here if you can as staying too tight on the inside with hamper your exit. 

[b]T7/8[/b] 
T7 and 8 are gentle corners with this car, just take the path of least resistance through here and stay over to the right hand side to prepare for T9. 

[b]T9 [/b]
T9 is a wonderful long sweeping corner in 4th gear. I find the trick to a consistent way through this corner is to use where the gradient of the kerb on the inside increases. With a gentle steering angle, take a full throttle approach to the inside and when the kerb gets steeper, begin to balance the throttle to hold the car towards the inside and let the car drift about half way across the track as you approach the top of the hill, then feed the car back over to the left hand side for T10 

[b]T10 – Spin / Crash / Overtake [/b]
T10 is a deceptively tricky corner primarily due to the sharp downhill braking. Make sure you have got straightened out of T9 and once you get to the top of the crest, brake and shift down to 3rd gear. If 2nd works better for you then go for it, but I prefer the stability of 3rd. Make sure to give yourself as much time as you need to get the car slowed down as it is incredibly easy to run a bit deep and if you try to get the car to the apex from that point the back end will step out on you. Don’t run too far wide out of T10 as you will need to open out T11 and it’s completely flat out all the way round to T1 from here, so you need to get this right. You might get the odd looney who wants to make a move here and I suppose it is a viable overtake spot on the final lap as an example. 

[b]T11 / T12 [/b]
To finish off the lap, take the path of least resistance here like in T7/8. You can save a small amount of time from just making sure you clip your apexes here and get a good run back to T1.
