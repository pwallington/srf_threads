[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series @ [b] Daytona International Speedway ca.2007 - Road Course[/b]
Week 1 of 12 - 2017 Season 3 [/size][/color]
Race Distance: [b]12 laps[/b], approximately 25 minutes
World Record lap time: [b]None yet![/b] by .
(n.b. random/dynamic weather impacts lap times greatly)

Welcome to The 'historic' (and free!) 2007 rendition of Daytona Speedway. The road course at this iconic 2.5-mile oval is a refular host of SCCA Majors and Runoffs for the real-life Spec Racers, now it's your chance to follow their example. This track has a lot of high-speed draft sections around the banked oval, making tight pack racing a guarantee, and strategy a must!

[b][u]N.B.: Please read important note below about NOT running on the apron below the banked corners![/u][/b]

Target "planned" SoF race is usually 20:45 GMT Sunday, immediately following the Weekend Warriors league race.

[size=18][b]TRACK NOTES[/b][/size]

This track is new to the official iRacing SRF series, but well known to real-life SRF racing. No notes yet except this very important PSA...

[color=red][b]IMPORTANT:[/b][/color]The painted line at the bottom of the banking defines the edge of the 'racing surface', according to iRacing staff[1]. Do not run below this line attempting to 'shortcut' the corners. Even though you will not get a 1x this *is* a protestable violation of the Sporting Code.
