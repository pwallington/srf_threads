[size=18][b]TRACK NOTES[/b][/size]

[i]Track notes courtesy of Luca Varani[/i]
Watkins Glen is a draft track, which leads to very exciting battles but can also end in tears. 
Just be patient, don't take unnecessary risks and you will be rewarded with 25 minutes of close racing.

[b]Turn 1 right : the 90 [/b]
A difficult corner. The curb can spin your car if it is too low. You can take some of it, but not much. 
There is a generous run off that can be used without 1x, if necessary. 
Having a good exit is paramount since you will have to carry the speed uphill with full throttle until the Carousel 
Overtakes here are possible but not recommended: both cars will be slowed down and struggle in the uphill section. 

[b]Turns 2,3,4, The Esses [/b]
Don't attempt to overtake through this flat-out uphill section - instead use the draft to time your attack on the following straight, and overtake before/into the chicane coming up. 

[b]Turn 5a, Inner Loop / Chicane [/b]
With a stong draft up the uphill section this is a good overtaking opportunity. However, you have to be careful as you're approaching the corner much faster than normal, and can easily overshoot the entry or accidentally dive-bomb the car in front. Take care to avoid an accident! Going side-by-side through the chicane itself is extremely difficult due to the narrow line, and is not recommended. 

[b]Turn 5 right, Carousel [/b]
The main overtaking spot in this configuration. Draft on the back straight and attack at the Carousel, after light braking. You can make it stick both on the inside and outside and experienced drivers can even remain 3 wide through the corner. Do not attempt to do so unless both you and the drivers alongside are very confident with the SRF. 

[b]Turn 6 left and turn 7 right [/b]
Two fast corners, the first one may require no braking depending on the weather. 
It is easy to loose control here, especially by running over the curbs with the steering wheel at the wrong angle. 
There are often cars spinning into the gravel outside T10L or against the wall exiting T11R. 
Side by side racing here requires utmost trust in the cars around you and very good car control. In this configuratino the draft out of the carousel makes attacking into T6 a possibility, but if you can't complete the pass before the corner then both cars will lose a LOT of time to the rest of the field. In general there are better passing opportunities so this is not recommended.
