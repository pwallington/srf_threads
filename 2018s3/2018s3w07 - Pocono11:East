Week 7 of 12 - 2018 Season 3 [/size][/color]
Race Distance: [b]22 laps[/b], approximately 25 minutes
World Record lap time: [b]None[/b] by Yet!
(n.b. random/dynamic weather impacts lap times greatly)

Welcome to Pocono! This is a brand new track to the SRF rotation, the newly-free 2011 version of the famous Pocono raceway. To start with we are trying the winding 'East' layout, which uses a lot of infield and hardly any of the oval segments. A short and winding track, but several corners lack good sighting points, so take care when learning it.

Target "planned" SoF race is usually 20:45 GMT Sunday, immediately following the Weekend Warriors league race.
