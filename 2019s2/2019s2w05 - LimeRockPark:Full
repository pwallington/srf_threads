[size=18][b]TRACK NOTES[/b][/size]

[u]Turn 1 right "Big Bend":[/u] The only major overtaking opportunity on the lap, following the draft from the main straight. Also the scene of [u]many[/u] accidents! If you do not complete a pass before the corner, be careful to hold your line right through the corner. The SRF is not an easy car to trail brake, which can impact the entrance to this corner especially. The inside line works best as the car tends to drift wide from the outside line, putting you onto the grass.

[u]Turn 3 "The Left Hander":[/u] Be careful with the change in direction that can unsettle the car. Many drivers take a very late apex, so be careful tryimng to enter a gap on the inside - it's likely to close very quickly.

[u]"No-name straight":[/u] Not an easy place to overtake - the line through the kinks is barely wide enough for two cars, and you are unlikely to complete the pass before the difficult uphill turn 5 coming up.

[u]Turn 5 right "The Uphill":[/u] A fast and dangerous corner. A good run through here will most likely get you airborne over the steep crest on the exit. Be careful to keep the car straight, and watch out for cars spinning or bouncing back onto the track from the close walls. The elevation changes and lack of runoff makes going side-by-side through here a bad idea! Instead, get a better exit speed than the car ahead for a chance to overtake into the next corner - this straight can also be an opportunity to get past lapped cars.

[u]Turn 6 right "West Bend":[/u] There is a nasty bump in the kerb on the apex that can unsettle the car - be especially careful of this if overtaking here. The wall outside the corner is very unforgiving, and be careful to avoid getting onto the grass on the exit because you will end up hitting the bridge parapet.

[u]Turn 7 right "Diving turn":[/u] Overtaking through this fast corner is not generally a good idea unless it's the last lap of the race. The lost speed will cost both cars a lot of time down the following straight. Much better to concentrate on carrying as much speed as possible and using the draft to pass on the main straight.
