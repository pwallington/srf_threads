(n.b. random/dynamic weather impacts lap times greatly)

Week 12 takes us to the historic Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, affectionately known just as "Spa". This long track makes for epic draft battles with the SRF. Strategy will be key to good results here - time your attacks carefully and plan for a close finish!

[color=red][b]N.B. due to the length of the lap there is only time for ONE qualifying lap. As the offtracks are very tight here it's recommended to be careful to post a valid time![/b][/color]

Target "planned" SoF race is usually 20:45 GMT Sunday, immediately following the Weekend Warriors league race.

[size=18][b]TRACK NOTES[/b][/size]

Spa is a great track for racing thanks to the huge draft leading to race long battles.
It is, however, easy to turn excitement into despair if you are not careful.

It is important to realize that:
- There are many passing opportunities per lap, there is no reason to take any risk. Pass only when it is safe to do so.
- The draft will give you a lot of speed, but this doesn't mean that you are obliged to keep that foot on the gas. Lifting to avoid troubles is a smart thing to do. Everybody can smash the throttle, force a 3 wide and cause a crash. It takes courage to lift and wait for a better opportunity.
- Prolonged side by side battles in corners will slow everyone down. Decide if this is the tactic you want to use. It is often faster to sit behind another car for part of the track.
- You will reach the corners with higher speed due to the draft. You need to adjust your braking and entry to avoid losing control.
- Remember that voluntarily taking advantages of 1x is unsportmanlike and against the sporting code!


[u][i]Turn 2 to 4, - Eau Rouge, Radillon complex - [/i][/u]
One of the most famous corners in the world. It is taken flat out in the SRF but it can become very difficult alongside another car.
Do not attempt to pass here, it will slow you down and it is generally pointless.
Just use the draft on the following Kemmel straight to gain time (0.6s or more) and positions.

[u][i]Turn 5 right, - Les Combes [/i][/u]
Plenty of passing braking into this corner. Just avoid dive bombing, be aware that you will carry a higher speed due to the draft and leave room to the cars alongside you.

[u][i]Turn 6 left ant 7 right, - Malmedy [/i][/u]
Passing should not be initiated here. However, overtaking started at Les Combes often result in cars entering these corners together.
You will have to sacrifice some speed to allow safe side by side racing.

[u][i]Turn 8 right, - Rivage [/i][/u]
You can attack on the inside under the heavy, downhill braking for Rivage.

[u][i]Turn 9 left [/i][/u]
Very narrow line through this corner that will easily take your car off-track on the outside.
No passing should be attempted here, barring exceptional circumstances. It will just cost you time.

[u][i]Turn 10-11 left, - Pouhon. Turn 12-13, Fagnes. Turn 14-15, Paul Frere[/i][/u]
No passing in all these corners, except perhaps on the last lap.
Attacking here will cost nothing and accomplish little to nothing since they are followed by the long straight leading to Blanchimont, where the draft is worth several tenths.

[u][i] Turn 18-19, chicane [/i][/u]
A major overtaking spot but also a dangerous one. It is difficult for two cars to navigate this narrow chicane together; both drivers need to give room and sacrifice speed.
Avoid dive bombing. If you are not fully alongside at the braking point you should not attempt to pass.

[u][i] Turn 1, La Source [/i][/u]
Passing can be done under braking for this slow corner. You can also try to cut under another car and pass under acceleration exiting the corner. La Source can be a valid overtaking point on the last lap.
However, this is all pointless in normal racing conditions. It is much better to sit behind another car and use the draft on the Kemmel straight to overtake. Passing at La Source will only cost you time.
