[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series @ [b] Nurburgring Nordschleife - Industriefahrten[/b]
Week 11 of 12 - 2019 Season 3 [/size][/color]
Race Distance: [b]3 laps[/b], approximately 25 minutes
World Record lap time: [b]8:08.157 (TT)[/b] by Daniil Manaenkov
(n.b. random/dynamic weather impacts lap times greatly)

This week we travel to the famous 'Green Hell' - Nurburgring Nordschleife. This is the industriefahrten layout - i.e. NOT including the GP track.
[size=18][color=red][b]IMPORTANT NOTES THIS WEEK[/b][/color][/size]
	- There are [b]separate qualifying sessions[/b] (starting 15 minutes past each hour), not the normal attached qualifying!
	- The track takes a LONG time to load on most PCs - be aware of this and join the race session in plenty of time!
	- We only have 3 laps in the race - survival is paramount because a tow back to the pits will basically end your race. Concentrate on being clean and safe and you will get a good result.
	- [b]Static weather for all sessions this week[/b] - no need to worry about track temperature :)

Typically the best SoF races are usually the first race of the week, and 22:45 GMT Sunday (following the Weekend Warriors league race)

[size=18][b]TRACK NOTES[/b][/size]

Here's a basic turn-by-turn guide I wrote for myself first time we ran here: [url]https://gist.github.com/pwallington/7ec44ed5e9422ebf4b8a17530db6d92c[/url].

Some important general notes:
       - There are not many overtaking opportunities early on in the lap - especially on lap 1, BE PATIENT and you will have plenty of chances later on.
       - The SRF really doesn't like the kerbs, especially on the exits of corners - be careful!
       - The relatively low power of the SRF makes many of the faster corners easy flat-out or with a small lift

You can complete a full 8 week season by acquiring [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3288130.page]only 3 paid tracks[/url], if you don't have any.
