[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series @ [b] Oran Park Raceway - Grand Prix[/b]
Week 5 of 12 - 2019 Season 3 [/size][/color]
Race Distance: [b]17 laps[/b], approximately 25 minutes
World Record lap time: [b]none[/b] by anybody, yet!
(n.b. random/dynamic weather impacts lap times greatly)

This week we head 'down under' to Oran Park Raceway. Mapped by iRacing shortly before it's demolition in 2010, this historic circuit was well known for v8 Supercars racing, and now lives on forever in iRacing. We're using the longest "Grand Prix" layout, which comprises 12 turns over 1.6 mils, including the crossover bridge which makes it one of the few 'figure-8' tracks available.

Typically the best SoF races are usually the first race of the week, and 22:45 GMT Sunday (following the Weekend Warriors league race)
