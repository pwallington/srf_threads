[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series @ [b] Pocono Raceway 2011 - North[/b]
Week 1 of 12 - 2019 Season 3 [/size][/color]
Race Distance: [b]22 laps[/b], approximately 25 minutes
World Record lap time: [b]None[/b] by Yet!
(n.b. random/dynamic weather impacts lap times greatly)

Welcome to Pocono! This is a new track to the SRF rotation, the newly-free 2011 version of the famous Pocono raceway. This time we are using the 'North' layout, which uses a lot of infield and hardly any of the oval segments. A short and winding track, but several corners lack good sighting points, so take care when learning it.

Target "planned" SoF race is usually 20:45 GMT Sunday, immediately following the Weekend Warriors league race.
