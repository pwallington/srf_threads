[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series @ [b] Autodromo Nazionale Monza - Junior[/b]
Week 2 of 12 - 2019 Season 3 [/size][/color]
Race Distance: [b]26 laps[/b], approximately 25 minutes
World Record lap time: [b]None[/b] by Yet!
(n.b. random/dynamic weather impacts lap times greatly)

Welcome to Monza Junior! This is a new track to the SRF rotation, the short 'Junior' layout of the famous Monza racetrack. This layout uses an infield track link to cut across from the start-finish straight to rejoin the track just after the Ascari chicane, with drivers heading down the back straight to the Parabolica before starting another lap. Short laps with only a few turns will likely make for some hectic racing - don't get dizzy!

Target "planned" SoF race is usually 20:45 GMT Sunday, immediately following the Weekend Warriors league race.
