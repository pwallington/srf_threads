[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series @ [b] Suzuka International Course - West[/b]
Week 9 of 12 - 2019 Season 3 [/size][/color]
Race Distance: [b]20 laps[/b], approximately 25 minutes
World Record lap time: [b]1:31.269[/b] by Aday Coba Lopez (Qualifying)
(n.b. random/dynamic weather impacts lap times greatly)

Welcome to the world-famous Suzuka International Circuit - home to some fantastic Grand Prix racing over many years. This track makes for some great SRF racing, so it's definitely worth the effort to learn it! This time we are using the West layout, which comprises most of the second half of the GP layout. From the Degner Curves through the Hairpin to Spoon and 130R, these are some iconic and challenging corners!

Typically the best SoF races are usually the first race of the week, and 22:45 GMT Sunday (following the Weekend Warriors league race)

[size=18][b]TRACK NOTES[/b][/size]

[i]Track notes courtesy of Luca Varani[/i]
[u][i] Turn 1 Left, 130R[/i][/u]
The draft on the straight can tempt you to try and attack here. This corner, however, should not be taken side by side. The chances of running into each other (or pushing somebody off track) are really high. Both drivers will need to slow down a lot to allow side by side racing here.

[u][i] Turn 2-3 Right, Track Cut[/i][/u]
A passing opportunity here when braking for the access road that cuts the track. It's better to attempt here than in 130R, but be careful not to dive bomb or cut into another car in the narrow right/right racing line.

[u][i] Turn 4 Right, Degner[/i][/u]
A difficult corner with a very narrow line. Exiting wide can launch your car on the curb and spin you.
It's better not to attempt a pass here.

[u][i] Turn 7 Left, Hairpin[/i][/u]
Heavy braking for the hairpin may allow attacking on both inside and, more difficult, outside.
Just be careful: passing must be initiated around Turn 6, where cars can drift wide and leave no room for others.

[u][i] Turn 9-10 Left, Spoon[/i][/u]
You might be tempted to attack here after getting a good draft on the straight following the hairpin ('Turn 8' is actually a very long sweeper, but it's easily flat out in the SRF). Navigating Spoon corner with a car alongside you is far from easy, however; so be extra careful and wait for a better passing opportunity if you can afford it.

Overall, passing is not that easy on this track. Be patient and play your chances right, though, and you will have some wonderful racing.
