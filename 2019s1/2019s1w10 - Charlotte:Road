[color=red][size=18]Spec Racer Ford Challenge Series @ [b] Charlotte Motor Speedway - Road Course[/b]
Week 10 of 12 - 2019 Season 1 [/size][/color]
Race Distance: [b]18 laps[/b], approximately 25 minutes
World Record lap time: [b]1:20.305[/b] by Gabriel Tobar
(n.b. random/dynamic weather impacts lap times greatly)

This week head to the new and updated Charlotte Motor Speedway's "Roval" layout. A combination of the twisty infield and 3/4 of the full oval makes for great racing. The strong draft around the oval section will lead to a lot of last-lap strategy - do you wait behind the leader to pass on the oval, or try to lead out the whole last lap?

Target "planned" SoF race is usually 20:45 GMT Sunday, immediately following the Weekend Warriors league race.

[size=18][b]TRACK NOTES[/b][/size]

[color=red][b]IMPORTANT:[/b][/color]The line at the bottom of the banking defines the edge of the 'racing surface', according to iRacing staff. [b]Do not run below this line[/b] attempting to 'shortcut' the corners. Even though you will not get a 1x this *is* a protestable violation of the Sporting Code.
