This week we head to Detroit and the new-to-iRacing Belle Isle track. A classic track in American motorsports, Belle Isle hosts a variety or racing formats but most notably the IndyCar Detroit Grand Prix. A tight, technical, bumpy street circuit with few if any runoffs - this will be a challenging and punishing venue to race at! This is the first SRF visit to the track, so leave your thoughts, impressions, notes and questions below!

Target "planned" SoF race is usually 20:45 GMT Sunday, immediately following the Weekend Warriors league race.
