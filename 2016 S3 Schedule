[size=18][b]USEFUL INFO FOR NEWCOMERS[/b][/size]
(Suggestions/improvements to this reference info are always appreciated!)

Read this first: [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/2022116.page] Zen and the Art of the Spec Racer Ford [/url]

The recently updated [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3475225.page]baseline setup[/url] is an excellent starting point for any driver.

You can complete a full 8 week season by acquiring [url=http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/3288130.page]only 3 paid tracks[/url], if you don't have any.

N.B. The weather settings are random in each session. There is no point comparing laptimes from different servers.
